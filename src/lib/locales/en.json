My high school participated, and the concept involved the school choosing a theme, and a Unicorn employee worked with students to create the application. Frontend was developed in React, backend in Node.js, and MongoDB was used as the database (Unicorn uses a modified version of React, Node, and MongoDB). After almost a year of work, we created a school library where students can borrow and return books. Teachers can perform CRUD operations for books and categories, and the admin (manager) can grant permissions to teachers (manage the library). I created the application by myself.",
